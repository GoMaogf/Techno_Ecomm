NOTE: in the free webhosting that we've used which is "000webhosting" we encountered a problem that we think 000webhosting is at fault. We cannot add any value in the database that 000webhosting created. Although we can access the records from the database which is a good thing. The solution for this problem is to probably upgrade the webhosting account to a premium one instead of the free account.
The directory made in this github is set to default as localhost and the directory of where the file is.
